=============================================================

Here's some UNIVARIANT data (1 variable, many readings): [105, 129, 87, 86, 111, 111, 89, 81, 108, 92, 110, 100, 75, 105, 103, 109, 76, 119, 99, 91, 103, 129, 106, 101, 84, 111, 74, 87, 86, 103, 103, 106, 86, 111, 75, 87, 102, 121, 111, 88, 89, 101, 106, 95, 103, 107, 101, 81, 109, 104]

x (hour of day):[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

y (temperature):[2, 5, 8, 20, 21, 23, 24, 27, 30, 31, 31, 32]

Calculate the slope and intercept of a best fit straight line:
   slope = 2.78
   intercept = 3.12

Let's use our best fit line to PREDICT a future value.

   At the13th hour, the temp. will be 39 degrees.

How'd we do? Does this make sense given the data?
